Quaker Houghton Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Quaker Houghton ("the Company") (NYSE: KWR), the global leader in industrial process fluids, announced its third quarter 2024 results today. 
        Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation common shareholders – diluted
        Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $462.3 million, a decline of approximately 6% compared to $490.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. This result was due to a decrease in selling price and product mix of approximately 4%, which is primarily attributable to the impact of index based customer contracts, a decline in sales volumes of approximately 1% primarily reflecting a continuation of soft end market conditions, partially offset by new business wins, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1%.
        The Company reported net income in the third quarter of 2024 of $32.3 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33.7 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding non-recurring and non-core items in each period, the Company's non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share were $34.0 million and $1.89 respectively in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $36.9 million and $2.05 respectively in the prior year. The Company generated adjusted EBITDA of $78.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 7% compared to $84.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the decline in net sales as mentioned above.
        Andy Tometich, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, "The third quarter once again highlighted the resilience of Quaker Houghton. While end market conditions softened compared to the second quarter of 2024, our volumes remained consistent, driven by new business wins across our portfolio. We continue to perform well on our financial and operational priorities. Our segment operating margins have improved year-to-date, as we simplify our portfolio, and remain disciplined with our costs and investments, balancing our long-term objectives with the near-term market environment.
        "Looking ahead, we anticipate the current difficult market conditions will likely persist through the end of the year. Our focus remains on executing on what we can control, driving efficiencies and productivity for our Company and our customers. We are confident in the long-term positive fundamentals of the industry we serve and will further advance our enterprise strategy. Our investments will strengthen our ability to continue to deliver above market growth, especially as end markets recover. Additionally, our balance sheet and cash generation remain strong, providing avenues to accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value."
        The Company's third quarter 2024 operating performance for each of its three reportable segments: (i) Americas; (ii) EMEA; and (iii) Asia/Pacific, is further described below. 
        Net sales in the Asia/Pacific segment increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to an increase in sales volumes and a favorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a decline in selling price and product mix. Net sales in the Americas segment declined in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a decline in sales volumes and selling price and product mix, and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Net sales in the EMEA segment declined in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a decline in selling price and product mix, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes and a favorable impact of foreign currency translation.

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - The Trustees of North European Oil Royalty Trust (NYSE-NRT) announced today a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per unit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, payable on November 27, 2024 to owners of record on November 15, 2024. 
        In accordance with the agreements between the Trust and the operating companies, the Trust's monthly scheduled royalty payments are paid based on the amount of royalties that were payable to the Trust in the prior calendar quarter.  For the quarter ending October 31, 2024, the reduction in the amount of the distribution payable largely resulted from the carry-over negative adjustments from the prior quarter and the substantial negative adjustment from calendar 2023 under both the Mobil and OEG royalty agreements.  The negative carry-over adjustment from calendar 2023 will impact the scheduled royalty payments for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.  Further details will be available in the 10-K scheduled to be released on or about December 31, 2024.
        The cumulative 12-month distribution, which includes the November 2024 distribution and the three prior quarterly distributions, is $0.48 per unit.  This 12-month cumulative distribution is 78.8%, or $1.78 per unit, lower than the prior 12-month distribution of $2.26 per unit.  The Trust makes quarterly distributions to unit owners during the months of February, May, August, and November.

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - SM Energy Company (the "Company") (NYSE: SM) today reported operating and financial results for the third quarter 2024 and provided certain full year and fourth quarter 2024 guidance.
        Portfolio expansion sets up for an exciting 2025 with significantly increased scale:
        President and Chief Executive Officer Herb Vogel comments: "2024 is proving to be a highly successful year for SM Energy. Exceptional operational performance, magnified by increased top-tier portfolio scale and substantial oil production growth, supports a strong balance sheet and upside value creation opportunity.
        "Looking ahead, we are keenly focused on our Utah operations. Along with the investment community, we are invigorated by the opportunity to unlock value in an overlooked basin, and we expect to deliver results attributable to the crude profile, high margins and substantial scale that the Uinta Basin Acquisitions provide. In the fourth quarter, we expect to sequentially grow our oil and total production volumes by around 40% and 25%, respectively, and execute a smooth integration of the Utah operations. We will diligently work to develop a 2025-2027 operating plan that will optimize capital efficiency and demonstrate the value of our expanded portfolio.
        "We are very excited to be among the core operators in Utah. We welcome our new employees and look forward to becoming actively involved in our new communities."
        For additional operating metrics and regional detail, please see the Financial Highlights section below and the accompanying slide deck.

The primary drivers of increased net income were higher production volumes and lower operating and DD&A expenses per unit, partially offset by lower realized prices per unit and higher interest expense net of interest income. For the first nine months of 2024, net income was $582.0 million, or $5.03 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $570.8 million, or $4.75 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023. On a per share basis, the Company's stock repurchase program contributed to a 4.5 million share decrease in the weighted-average diluted share count during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024, further boosting EPS.
        Third quarter 2024 net cash provided by operating activities of $452.3 million before net change in working capital of $(32.0) million totaled $420.2 million,(1) compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $383.0 million before net change in working capital of $52.9 million that totaled $435.9 million(1) for the same period in 2023. The $(15.7) million, or 4%, decrease in the current year period is primarily due to lower realized prices and increased interest expense net of interest income, partially offset by higher production and lower costs. For the first nine months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,204.6 million before net change in working capital of $15.4 million totaled $1,220.1 million,(1) compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $1,097.9 million before net change in working capital of $57.3 million that totaled $1,155.2 million(1) for the same period in 2023.

        See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this release for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Diluted (Loss) Earnings per share, Unlevered and Levered Free Cash Flow, Net Working Capital, Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and their reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We have not provided reconciliations of our future expectations as to Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA margin as such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts.
        Chris Baker, KLX President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am very proud of our entire team for their outstanding performance during the third quarter. Facing continued market volatility, consolidation of our blue-chip customers and persistent rig count declines over the past few years, we generated our third-highest level of quarterly revenue per average US-operated land rig since the KLX-QES merger in 2020. 
        "We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results were at the top-end of our guidance ranges. Our geographic and product and service line ("PSL") diversification has driven margin sustainability in the face of market volatility, which we believe demonstrates the strength and resiliency of the KLX platform. Additionally, our leading presence in extended reach laterals, completion technologies, and production and intervention services should continue to yield differentiated performance.
        "Looking forward, based on seasonality, anticipated customer budget exhaustion and the upcoming calendar that includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays in the middle of the work week, we expect a fourth quarter 2024 sequential revenue decline of 10% to 14%, similar to 2023.
        "More importantly, we are currently in discussions with many of our customers on their 2025 drilling, completion and production programs. These conversations have been very constructive and indicate incremental positive momentum for 2025 with both new and existing customers, giving us cautious optimism as we begin our budgeting for next year," concluded Baker.
        Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $188.9 million, an increase of 4.8% compared to the second quarter of 2024 revenue of $180.2 million. The increase in revenue reflects incremental completion activity in the third quarter. By end market, drilling, completion, production and intervention solutions contributed approximately 21%, 54%, 16% and 9%, respectively, to revenue for the third quarter of 2024.
        Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(8.2) million, compared to the second quarter of 2024 net loss of $(8.0) million. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(6.4) million, compared to the second quarter of 2024 adjusted net loss of $(6.5) million. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $27.8 million, compared to the second quarter of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of $27.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 14.7%, compared to the second quarter of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.0%.
        The Company reports revenue, operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA through three geographic business segments: Rocky Mountains, Southwest and Northeast/Mid-Con. The Company reports operating activities not attributable to an individual geographic business segment through the Corporate and other segment.

Alamo Group Announces Third Quarter Financial Results And Cost Reduction Actions

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Alamo Group Inc. (NYSE: ALG) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.
        Third quarter 2024 net sales of $401.3 million decreased 4.4% compared to $419.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin of $100.9 million or 25.1% of net sales declined by $13.3 million and 206 basis points, impacted by sustained weakness in the forestry and agricultural markets. Continued growth in the Industrial Equipment Division partially offset weaker results in the Vegetation Management Division.
        Net income was $27.4 million or $2.28 per diluted share, compared to $34.9 million or $2.91 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.  The Company's backlog at the end of the third quarter was $728.8 million.  While Vegetation Management Division backlog declined by 52%, Industrial Equipment Division backlog continues to grow and is 8.5% higher versus prior year at this time. 
        For the first nine months of 2024, net sales of $1.2 billion were 2.3% below the prior year's first nine months. Gross margin of $320.7 million or 25.8% of net sales compared to $344.7 million or 27.1% of net sales in the prior year. Industrial Equipment Division net sales of $617.8 million grew 21.8%, offsetting lower Vegetation Management Division net sales of $625.4 million, which declined by 18.2% year over year.
        Net income for the first nine months was $87.8 million or $7.30 per diluted share, compared to $104.6 million or $8.73 per diluted share in the same period last year.
        As part of our commitment to optimize operations and enhance shareholder value, we are diligently executing cost saving initiatives inclusive of plant consolidations and workforce reductions. In the first nine months of 2024, we incurred approximately $3.2 million in employee separation costs and expect the total cost to be between $4.0 million to $4.5 million.  Through these ongoing actions, we anticipate achieving annualized cost savings in the range of $25 to $30 million. We have already begun to see some of these savings in the third quarter, with further savings expected to accelerate over the next 12 months.
        Jeff Leonard, Alamo Group's President, and Chief Executive Officer commented, "Our financial results for the third quarter were largely in line with our expectations given the conditions prevalent in our markets. As we experienced in the second quarter, market activity across our two segments continued to diverge.
        "Demand for products and services offered by the Industrial Equipment Division remained historically strong in all areas during the third quarter. Spending by governmental agencies to upgrade and modernize maintenance fleets continued at a good pace. In addition, demand from industrial contractors remained strong, and rental fleet utilization was at a healthy level. We were pleased that demand for snow removal equipment remained strong in the third quarter. This Division reported solid sales growth and excellent profitability in the third quarter and its backlog remained elevated.
        "The softness in markets for Vegetation Management equipment continued during the quarter as elevated interest rates and a challenging macro economy constrained demand. Sales for agricultural mowers and related equipment were muted as farm incomes remained under pressure. Farm equipment dealer inventory, despite coming down most of this year, remained elevated. Weakness in the US housing sector continued to suppress demand for our forestry and tree care products during the quarter. Governmental mowing was once again a bright spot for this Division, and we were pleased to see that our new Mantis prime mover continued to gain acceptance among state and municipal agencies. With difficulties in forestry and agriculture, the Division's net sales declined 23% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Division's operating margin declined under pressure from costs associated with inventory reduction actions, excess capacity, lower efficiency and separation costs.
        "To address the weakness in our Vegetation Management Division, during the third quarter we initiated additional efficiency improvement measures aimed at further reducing excess manufacturing capacity. These measures include the sale of our Herschel Parts business to F.P. Bourgalt Tillage Tools Ltd., consolidation of manufacturing of the rotary mowers and other agricultural products, and consolidation of manufacturing of forestry and tree care products. These consolidations will improve the efficiency and utilization of our larger facilities while reducing longer-term capital requirements.

Propane Industry Mobilizes to Provide Lifesaving Energy to Hurricane Survivors

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - During the historic 2024 hurricane season, hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost access to power, heat, cooking, and hot water, creating an urgent need for propane to get through the ensuing days and weeks. Propane companies around the country have rallied to provide immediate and long-term relief, helping communities get back on their feet. From local suppliers restoring services to customers in their own communities to regional and national companies dispatching fuel and supplies to hard-hit areas, the propane industry is uniquely positioned to provide essential energy that saves lives.
        "What we've seen on display in communities across the southeast is the very best of the propane industry," said Tucker Perkins, president and CEO of the Propane Education & Research Council (PERC). "Each propane retail location is part of the fabric of its community. Springing into action after disaster strikes is a natural extension of that spirit of helping our neighbors. Millions of American homes and businesses rely on propane to power their everyday lives, but it's the people in the industry who ultimately make the difference."
        Here are just a few examples of propane companies making a difference in response to Hurricane Helene in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia:
        Stringer Oil & LP Gas (Anderson, SC)Stringer, a small operation with six employees total, organized propane cylinders, parts, and other supplies and delivered them to several locations in western North Carolina, including Bakersville, Burnsville, and Newland. Stringer delivered 50 propane cylinders and 200 propane tank regulators to Youngs Fuel Service, another small family-owned company that suffered severe losses to the storm.  Owner Reagan Bonnette has returned to western North Carolina several times and plans to make regular visits to bring supplies and offer support to communities attempting to rebuild as winter approaches.
        "This recovery is a marathon, not a sprint," said Bonnette. "People have lost everything, and they continue to need help and encouragement, especially with the holidays coming up."
        Blossman Gas (Ocean Springs, MS)Blossman Gas was able to put 36 propane autogas-fueled fuel delivery trucks into service one day after Helene struck in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, despite the difficulty in accessing retail locations in affected areas and some employees losing their homes. Thanks to onsite propane-powered generators, Blossman was able to fill more than 4,000 grill cylinders in the first eight days after the storm at its Asheville, NC, branch and 1,600 at its Hendersonville, NC branch. Blossman's planning and mobilization allowed the company to support local, state, and federal agencies responding to the disaster.
        Paraco Gas (Rye Brook, NY)Starting Monday, September 30th, Paraco deployed nine tractor trailers from Waterbury, CT, to deliver propane tanks to 21 critical locations across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. By the end of the operation, Paraco delivered more than 12,000 propane tanks.
        Southeast Propane AllianceThe technical team of the Southeast Propane Alliance (SEPATEC), with support from Rinnai, Gardner Marsh, and LG Jordan Oil & Gas (Apex, NC), designed and assembled a portable hot water shower system capable of supplying water for laundry and eight shower units. The unit was assembled at Blossman's staging area in Asheville for use by the community.
        Foster Fuels, Inc. (Brookneal, VA)Foster Fuels, under a contract with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), sent 150 trucks and 200 personnel to affected areas, dispatching more than 500,000 gallons of propane and other fuels to power critical relief operations.

We are thrilled to unveil our first product using this new technology: the O° shoe, which is made using 100% PHA, is 100% biodegradable, and has no petrochemicals or microplastics."
        0% petrochemicals, 0% forever chemicals, 0% microplastics, and 100% biodegradablePHAs can be produced by bacteria which consume atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and/or food waste, reducing carbon in the environment as they grow. They are biologically recyclable, and 100% biodegradable in ambient conditions. As a result, O° textiles and shoes do not leave behind microplastics when they decompose. O° textiles and shoes are made entirely of PHAs, so when they decompose they become one with the environment, returning to the bacteria from which they originated. However, just like traditional biodegradable materials used for apparel such as cotton, wool, and silk, PHA will not biodegrade while being worn, washed, or stored.
        A high-efficiency design processO° shoes embody the versatility of PHAs by incorporating precise designs informed by the kinetics of human motion. Whether they take final form as a walking or running shoe, or ballet slipper, each shoe has a base layer of a knitted upper and outer layers that are printed on the textile to provide specific functionality including reinforcement, cushioning, strength, and pliability. The versatility and automation built into the O° platform enable rapid iterations and  an accelerated development process from design to production.
        A near zero-waste production processA compact robotic system is central to the O° platform: the O° robotic system 3D prints custom PHA blends onto a textile that is 3D knitted on an industrial flatbed machine from a 100% PHA yarn produced through a process of extrusion and melt spinning. By using this knitting and printing technology to create shape and movement, OXMAN has eliminated the cut-and-sew and adhesion processes associated with traditional shoe assembly. The O° technology offers a near zero-waste production process and requires minimal human involvement and intervention, enabling local, low-cost production, minimizing the transport cost and environmental impact of the distant supply chains typical of the shoe industry.
        Bio-engineered colorways, free of petrochemicalsMany industrial pigments and dyes are sourced from raw materials derived from petro-chemicals which release environmentally damaging chemicals during their production and usage. These dyes and pigments are dependent on a resource-intensive and complex global supply chain for synthesis, processing, and transport. In contrast, bacteria can produce pigments from simple and abundant natural resources. O° uses bacteria not just as a source of material, but also to encode other functional properties such as pigment production to simplify and centralize the manufacturing process.
        OXMAN's O° platform builds on the promise of PHAs by tuning the fabrication process and offering an alternative design and production process that holistically considers a product's entire lifecycle, from conception to decomposition. 
        OXMAN is now initiating discussions with potential partners, investors, and brand collaborators to bring the production of O° shoes and textiles to scale and to market.  We look forward to hearing from you. You can reach us here.
        About OXMAN: OXMAN is a design lab whose mission is to create and deliver nature-centric products and environments to its clients and the natural world. Bringing together computational design, robotics, materials science, green chemistry, biology, and eco-system engineering, OXMAN's work reinvents the industrial systems that dictate how we design and produce everyday things—from the foods we eat and the clothes we wear to the buildings we inhabit. https://oxman.com

Hot Chili Issues Quarterly Report for Q3 2024

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - The Preliminary Economic Assessment referred to in this Report is equivalent to a Scoping Study under JORC Code (2012) reporting guidelines.  It has been undertaken for the purpose of initial evaluation of a potential development of the Costa Fuego Copper Project in Chile. It is a preliminary technical and economic study of the potential viability of the Costa Fuego Copper Project. The PEA outcomes, production target and forecast financial information referred to in the Report are based on low level technical and economic assessments that are insufficient to support estimation of Ore Reserves. The PEA is presented in US dollars to an accuracy level of +/- 35%. While each of the modifying factors was considered and applied, there is no certainty of eventual conversion to Ore Reserves or that the production target itself will be realised. Further exploration and evaluation and appropriate studies are required before Hot Chili will be in a position to estimate any Ore Reserves or to provide any assurance of any economic development case. Given the uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely on the results of the PEA.
        Of the Mineral Resources scheduled for extraction in the PEA production plan, approximately 99% are classified as Indicated and 1% as Inferred. The Company has concluded that it has reasonable grounds for disclosing a production target which includes a small amount of Inferred Mineral Resources, as permitted under the JORC Code. There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Mineral Resources or that the production target itself will be realised. The viability of the development scenario envisaged in the PEA does not depend on the inclusion of Inferred Mineral Resources. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource with continued drilling.
        The Mineral Resources underpinning the production target in the PEA have been prepared by a competent person in accordance with the requirements of the JORC 2012. For full details on the Mineral Resource estimate, please refer to the ASX announcement of 31 March 2022. The Mineral Resource Estimate update released in February 2024 does not materially change the Mineral Resource inventory that formed the basis of the 2023 PEA, and no new scientific or technical information has been developed that would materially affect the outcome of the 2023 PEA and, therefore, the results and conclusions of the 2023 PEA are considered current and have been restated for this Report.
        To achieve the outcomes indicated in the PEA, including reaching Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS"), mine construction and production stages, funding in the order of US$1.10 Billion will be required, including pre-production and working capital and assumed financing charges. Investors should note that that there is no certainty that Hot Chili will be able to raise that amount of funding when needed. One of the key assumptions is that the funding for the Project will be available when required and on acceptable terms. It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive to, or otherwise affect the value of, Hot Chili's existing shares. It is also possible that Hot Chili could pursue other value realisation strategies such as debt financing, a sale or partial sale of its interest in the Costa Fuego Copper Project and/or Huasco Water, sale of further royalties and/or streaming rights, sale of non-committed offtake rights, and sale of non-core assets.
        This Report contains forward-looking statements. Hot Chili has concluded that it has a reasonable basis for providing these forward-looking statements and believes it has a reasonable basis to expect it will be able to fund development of the Costa Fuego Copper Project. However, a number of factors could cause actual results or expectations to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Given the uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely of the results of the PEA.
        During the quarter ending September 2024, the Company continued to focus on several development study workstreams for Costa Fuego's Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
        Potential for improved molybdenum flotation recovery has been determined as part of final PFS metallurgy work programme, following review and analysis of previous flotation testwork. This higher recovery is expected to upgrade the value of molybdenum as a by-product credit in the PFS, when compared to reported values in the Company's 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) and increase the annual quantity of molybdenum concentrate projected to be produced.
        Additional geometallurgical testwork was completed for acid-consumption analysis, to support predictive relationships between geological and alteration units at Productora and Cortadera for the planned heap and run-of-mine leach processing.  Analysis is nearing completion and will enable optimisation of the throughput of the concentrator, as well as acid cost and recovery within the leaching circuit.  Early outcomes indicate significant improvements in copper oxide leach recoveries can be achieved through increased acid addition, when compared to the 2023 PEA.
        A final round of Locked-Cycle Tests further confirmed the quality of the Costa Fuego concentrates, with low levels of arsenic and other deleterious elements.  Additional seawater and freshwater flotation trade-off tests were also completed and re-confirmed the planned concentrator would see optimal recovery using seawater.
        Mine design for the four Costa Fuego mining locations (Productora, Cortadera, Alice and San Antonio) is in the final stages of review, incorporating all geological, geotechnical and mining information to confirm open pit stability and flow within the proposed block cave at Cortadera.  Mine designs are currently being scheduled using MineMax and Panel Caving Block Caving (PCBC) software to optimise the mining and stockpiling sequence, utiliizing Costa Fuego's capital and operating cost framework.

Suburban Propane and American Red Cross Team Up with Coppin State University to Raise Sickle Cell Awareness and Collect Blood in Baltimore

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. (NYSE: SPH), a nationwide distributor of propane, renewable propane, renewable natural gas, fuel oil and related products and services, as well as a marketer of natural gas and electricity and investor in low carbon fuel alternatives, partnered with the American Red Cross and Coppin State University in Baltimore on October 30th to host a blood donation event focused on raising awareness of sickle cell disease, and the urgent need for donations. This collaboration brings local communities together to support those impacted by the disease and increase vital blood donations for those in need.
        Sickle cell disease disproportionately affects individuals in black and brown communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1 in 365 African American births in the United States are diagnosed with sickle cell disease, making awareness and community support essential in combating its effects and managing the condition. Patients with sickle cell disease may require up to 100 units of blood annually to manage complications associated with their condition. This staggering statistic highlights the urgent need for donors to step forward to help their neighbors.
        "Blood donation is crucial as we strive to educate our communities about the disease and its transfusion requirements. Each patient requires a significant amount of blood annually to manage complications, highlighting the pressing demand for donors, particularly from the black and brown communities, who are more likely to be a match," said Nandini Sankara, spokesperson for Suburban Propane. "Every donation can transform lives by providing essential support to those fighting this disease. Together, we can ensure that individuals receive the critical transfusions necessary to enhance their quality of life."
        "Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic blood disorder in the U.S., and regular blood transfusions are critical to manage extreme pain and life-threatening complications. It is estimated that over 100,000 people have sickle cell disease and may require frequent blood transfusions throughout their lifetime — as many as 100 units of blood per patient each year. For patients with sickle cell disease, blood donors who are Black are almost three times more likely to be a match for the blood most commonly needed, compared with donors who are not Black or African American," said Jodi Zand, Red Cross Regional Donor Services Executive. "We are proud to partner with wonderful organizations like Suburban Propane and
        Coppin State University to help alleviate the pain and suffering of sickle cell disease. People who want to donate should go to redcrossblood.org to make an appointment.

Royal Canadian Mint Wins Two International Association Of Currency Affairs' 2024 Excellence In Currency Awards

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - The Royal Canadian Mint is delighted to have won two prestigious Excellence in Currency awards at the International Association of Currency Affairs' (IACA) 2024 Coin Conference in Lisbon, Portugal. The Mint was first recognized alongside the Central Bank of The Bahamas with the Best New Commemorative or Test Circulating Coin award for a world-first circulation coin featuring high-resolution colour on both the obverse and reverse of a coin marking the central bank's 50th anniversary. As well, the Mint's new, environmentally responsible process for plating bronze-coloured circulation coins earned the Best new coin product, process or manufacturing innovation award.
        "The Royal Canadian Mint is dedicated to advancing the art and science of coin manufacturing, not just for Canada and Canadians, but also for the benefit of the global currency industry," said Marie Lemay, President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint. "To be recognized in two award categories by IACA is a tremendous peer endorsement of our pursuit of innovation, which delivers great value for circulation coin users around the world and helps us find more caring and sustainable ways to produce our industry-leading products."
        The 2024-dated 25-cent circulation coin celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Central Bank of The Bahamas. It was produced in collaboration with the Royal Canadian Mint, that applied its proprietary colour pad-printing technology to both sides of this ground-breaking coin.  The obverse features the Coat of Arms of The Bahamas together with the words "Commonwealth of The Bahamas" which forms a crown around the Coat of Arms. Elements of the Coat of Arms are painted blue, white, pink, and green, highlighting the blue marlin, flamingo, and conch shell. On the reverse is a rendering of a native sloop, infused with red, white, and brown paint, in sea painted blue, near an island, accompanied by the inscriptions "THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE BAHAMAS", "50th ANNIVERSARY 1974-2024". In addition to entering general circulation on June 3, 2024, this coin was also made available to collectors in custom packaging.
        The Mint also developed and successfully scaled up a new electroplating process that is transforming the manufacturing of bronze plated circulation products by eliminating the use of cyanide required in traditional plating as well as harsh chemicals needed to treat waste water to municipal standards, and improving employee health and safety. The Mint's new chemistry safely and reliably produces plated materials for both bronze mono-colour coins, as well as bi- or tri-metallic coins typically used for higher denominations.
        The Excellence in Currency Awards were introduced by IACA in 2007 to promote and recognise excellence in currency issue, production, processing, management and distribution. The Mint is proud to have been recognized through several previous awards, most recently:
        About the Royal Canadian Mint: The Royal Canadian Mint is the Crown corporation responsible for the minting and distribution of Canada's circulation coins. The Mint is one of the largest and most versatile mints in the world, producing award-winning collector coins, market-leading bullion products, as well as Canada's prestigious military and civilian honours.

Monthly bills will drop for Duke Energy Carolinas customers in South Carolina beginning in November for annual adjustment to fuel costs

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Duke Energy Carolinas customers in South Carolina will see their electric rates fall starting Nov. 1 as part of an annual adjustment for the cost of fuel used to generate electricity at its power plants. As approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), today's average monthly residential bill will decrease by 12.7%.
        The total monthly impact of these rate changes for a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month is a decrease of $19.52, from $154.29 to $134.77.
        As approved by the PSCSC, rates for commercial customers will decrease 13.5% and rates for industrial customers will decrease 15.7%. The specific impact to individual customers will vary according to many factors including electric usage and customer profile dynamics.
        The decrease more than offsets the previously announced base rate increase approved by the PSCSC that took effect in August.
        Duke Energy Carolinas serves about 660,000 households and businesses primarily in the Upstate of South Carolina, including Greenville, Spartanburg and Anderson counties.
        Duke Energy Carolinas makes a fuel cost-recovery filing annually in South Carolina. The fuel rate is based on the projected cost of fuel used to provide electric service to the company's customers, plus a true up of the prior year's projection compared to actual costs incurred. The PSCSC reviews fuel costs and adjusts the fuel component of customer rates accordingly. Each year, this true-up proceeding is intended to resolve the difference between projected fuel costs and what is actually billed to the customer.
        The decrease for customer bills in this year's request is primarily driven by the decreased cost of natural gas year over year, plus a reduced true-up component since the previous fuel cost-recovery filing.
        Duke Energy Carolinas works to actively manage fuel contracts to keep costs as low as possible for customers. Bills reflect actual fuel costs – customers pay what the company pays.
        Customers struggling to pay their energy bills might qualify for assistance from various government and nonprofit programs for utility bills and other household expenses, or from the Share the Light Fund, a Duke Energy program that provides energy assistance. Duke Energy also offers programs and resources to help customers, as well as flexible payment arrangements to help customers experiencing uncertainty keep their accounts in good standing.
        To help all customers take control of their energy use, Duke Energy offers energy-saving tips and innovative efficiency programs for every budget. For example, the Home Energy House Call is a free in-home energy assessment that provides customers more information about how they use energy and strategies to save money on their monthly bill.

The FCL-X™ fire suppression agent represents a significant advancement in our ability to protect lives and property."
        Carlos Vicens, CEO and Director of FCL stated "AEST's reputation and commitment to excellence align perfectly with our mission to protect against potential fire hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries.  The FCL-X™ fire suppression agent is designed to mitigate the risks associated with lithium-ion battery fires, offering advanced technology tailored for efficient response. With this partnership, FCL aims to establish a robust US distribution network that ensures accessibility to this critical safety solution, ultimately safeguarding lives and property."
        The master distribution agreement with AEST primarily emphasizes the FCL-X™ Extinguishers and FCL-X™ PRO product lines, granting AEST certain exclusive distribution rights in the USA for a defined period. The Company retains the right to market all its products globally and may pursue additional distribution agreements worldwide and, in the USA, provided these do not conflict with the AEST agreement.
        AEST Fire and Safety provide professional equipment sales and services to the fire and rescue industry and has an extensive distribution network that covers key markets and regions in the USA. AEST has an established relationship with retailers and wholesalers and is a master distributor for key brands such as Morning Pride, Genesis Rescue Tools, Draeger, Artic Compressors, and BioEx Foam.

ZwickRoell Introduces New Mflow Extrusion Plastometer at Largest International Expo in Materials Testing

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - The new Mflow extrusion plastometer made its debut at ZwickRoell's testXpo, 32nd International Expo for Materials Testing. The instrument sets new standards in plastics testing in accordance with ASTM D1238 and ISO 1133-1/-2. Thanks to extensive modular possibilities and significant time savings for each test, it offers an unprecedented combination of performance, ease of use and flexibility.
        "The Mflow is the ideal solution for the plastics industry, where testing machine operators and laboratory managers must be able to rely on the precision of their melt flow tests," says Dennis Stöhr, Product Manager at ZwickRoell. The new Mflow extrusion plastometer measures both the melt mass flow rate (MFR) and the melt volume flow rate (MVR), while guaranteeing reliable and reproducible test results—both crucial for the quality assurance of plastic products.
        In its basic configuration, the Mflow performs tests according to method A for MFR and method B for MVR. Its modular design allows it to be modified to the specific needs of the plastics industry, with expandable features such as a cleaning function and a pneumatic weight-lifting unit with pegging function which eliminates the need to move weights manually. These enhancements provide greater adaptability and ensure the melt flow tester remains future proof for evolving laboratory demands.
        A key innovation of the Mflow is the substantial reduction in cleaning time between tests. Stöhr: "With improved accessibility and optimized surfaces, cleaning time is reduced by up to 30 percent, enabling successive tests to be carried out faster." This is a significant advantage for laboratories that are under incredible pressure to work more efficiently.
        The Mflow's design prioritizes ergonomics, providing an optimized working position, simplifying the process of filling the specimen material, and reducing physical strain on the operator. The integrated touch display and LED status indicators support intuitive operation, whether used with or without a PC. With the new Mflow, ZwickRoell is setting new standards in plastics testing. The combination of time efficiency, ergonomic design and flexible modularity makes the Mflow an indispensable tool in modern testing labs in the plastics industry and significantly contributes to increased productivity.
        ZwickRoell North America is a sales and service subsidiary of the ZwickRoell Group, headquartered in Ulm, Germany.

First Student Drives 4 Million Electric School Bus Miles, Expanding Industry-Leading Position

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - First Student, the trusted school transportation provider to millions of families and the leading provider of electrified student transportation, has officially surpassed four million miles driven on electric school buses, creating safer, quieter, and healthier rides to school for communities across North America. This announcement comes six months after First Student reached the 3 million mile mark, another major achievement for the rapidly growing company.
        First Student credits the acceleration of electrification to First Charge, the company's innovative EV charging solution, which is now available to all school districts. The technology simplifies the electrification process by eliminating the need for trenching, even in cold weather climates, and saves up to 50% in installation costs. More than 20 school districts are already using First Charge, and it is in the process of being installed in 40 additional districts.
        "Four million miles driven is a remarkable achievement, and for our team, it is just the beginning. I thank them for their work in setting a new standard for our industry," said First Student CEO & President John Kenning. "Electrification helps us achieve our mission of providing the safest possible ride to school so that children can reach their full potential/ By creating quieter, cleaner, and safer rides to school on electric school buses and helping districts scale deployments through First Charge, we can make the future of student transportation a reality today. I am confident our team will continue to drive the industry into this new era."
        At 4 million miles, First Student electric school buses have safely driven the equivalent of 160 trips around the world, more than any other transportation provider. Electric school buses are safer, quieter, and healthier for students and communities. First Student expects to cross 6 million electric miles driven by the end of the 2024-2025 school year.
        "We are excited to mark four million electric miles because electric school bus rides are safer for students and better for the environment," said First Student Head of Electrification Kevin Matthews. "First Student is committed to providing the safest rides for the school districts and families we serve, and we will continue to create the technology that sets the standard for the future of our industry."
        This milestone follows on the heels of a landmark agreement from First Student and Con Edison. The two companies recently announced a novel demonstration project in Brooklyn, New York, which will revolutionize how students are transported to school and how cities and utilities power their grids. The project includes a fleet of 12 electric school buses for Brooklyn schools topped with solar panels that will replace diesel buses. These panels, along with solar arrays on the rooftop of the facility, will create a unique energy generation, battery storage and power delivery system. The system will utilize Vehicle-to-Everything technology, allowing Con Edison the ability to send clean solar generated power anywhere on the grid using school bus batteries.
        Throughout the 2024-2025 school year, First Student expects to achieve numerous electrification milestones, including:
        The pace of First Student's electrification milestones has accelerated exponentially as the company pushes toward its goal of transitioning 30,000 diesel school buses to electric by 2035. Replacing just one diesel school bus with an electric school bus can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 54,000 pounds annually.

Evolve™ Registered in Hong Kong; Offering a Revolutionary Non-Lethal Rodent Control Solution

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - SenesTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNES), the leader in birth control to manage rodent pest populations, today announces the successful registration of Evolve™ in Hong Kong.
        Hong Kong welcomes Evolve™, an innovative, non-lethal rodent birth control solution designed to target rat infestations at their root. Unlike conventional methods, Evolve restricts rodent reproduction, offering an effective and humane way to manage infestations without posing risks to humans, pets, wildlife, or the environment. As a sustainable alternative to toxic baits and inhumane traps, Evolve represents a breakthrough in tackling Hong Kong's escalating rat problem.
        Developed by U.S.-based SenesTech, a leader in the animal pest fertility control industry, Evolve is the first and only soft bait specifically designed to reduce rat populations by limiting fertility. Launched earlier this year, Evolve offers a non-lethal, eco-friendly solution that has earned the "minimum risk" designation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This classification (FIFRA 25(b) exempt) highlights its low-risk profile for humans, the environment, and non-target species.
        Building on the success of Evolve Rat, SenesTech expanded its product line in May with the introduction of Evolve™ Mouse. Both products integrate seamlessly into existing pest management programs, providing long-term, sustainable control of rodent populations.
        In Hong Kong, Evolve is exclusively distributed by Fruit Tree Limited and its subsidiaries, Nobedbugs-HK and Chinchex Limited, prominent pest control service providers that have worked extensively with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the HKSAR government to register the products."We are excited to be the exclusive distributor of Evolve in Hong Kong," said Francisco Pazos Alvarino, Director of Fruit Tree Limited. "This product represents the future of rodent control, offering a significant competitive advantage while aligning with our mission to deliver effective, safe, and sustainable pest management solutions."
        Alvarino noted the shortcomings of conventional methods, such as poisonous baits and traps, which may quickly eliminate rodents but fail to address the long-term growth of rodent populations. "A single rat pair can produce up to 15,000 offspring annually. Without a fertility control solution, traditional methods are incomplete. That's where Evolve comes in, revolutionizing integrated pest management strategies by addressing reproduction."
        With an estimated rat population of 2.5 million, Hong Kong faces a serious rodent problem. Despite recent efforts by the FEHD, which reported the capture of 65,500 live rodents last year—a 39 percent increase from the previous year—the infestation continues to expand. Targeting the B2B market, Fruit Tree Limited sees vast potential for Evolve in Hong Kong, with plans to expand into Mainland China. Initially, Evolve™ Rat and Evolve™ Mouse will be available in 1.5 lb, 3 lb and 6 lb packages through NoBedBugs-HK. For more information, visit www.nobedbugs-hk.com/pests/rodents.
        Research shows Evolve can reduce fertility in rodent populations by up to 90 percent when integrated into pest management programs. By addressing rodent reproduction, Evolve enhances the overall effectiveness of current control measures. SenesTech CEO, Joel Fruendt, remarked, "We're not just offering a product; we're delivering a solution to an urgent problem. Evolve isn't just about controlling the rodent population—it's about taking back our spaces from the growing threat of infestation."
        Fruit Tree Limited is a reputable pest control company specializing in providing effective and sustainable solutions for pest management. Fruit Tree places great emphasis on R&D to continually enhance our services and products. We invest in cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with industry experts to stay at the forefront of pest control and insecticide innovation. Our dedicated team of professionals is driven by a passion for excellence and a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and environmental responsibility to serve both residential and commercial clients in Hong Kong in the name of two subsidiaries:Nobedbugs-hk - a leading provider of pest control services, andChinchex Limited - a renowned manufacturer and distributor of bed bug insecticide in South East Asia countries.
        We are committed to improving the health of the world by humanely managing animal pest populations through our expertise in fertility control. We are the inventors of Evolve™ Rat and Evolve™ Mouse, EPA-designated minimum risk contraceptives for rodents which reflect our mission to provide products that are proactive, safe and sustainable. Evolve fits seamlessly into all integrated pest management programs, significantly improving the overall goal of effective pest management. We strive for clean cities, efficient businesses and happy households – with a product designed to be humane, effective and sustainable.

Bolster Unveils AI Security for Email: A Game-Changing Defense Against Phishing and Impersonation Scams

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - To help organizations fight the sharp rise in AI-backed phishing and impersonation attempts, Bolster, a leader in multi-channel phishing protection, today released a new feature, Bolster AI Security for Email, which automates the analysis and mitigation of cyber threats reported through customer abuse mailboxes.
        "Manual triage and processing by Tier-1 and Tier-2 security operations center (SOC) analysts is time-consuming and wildly costly for organizations. These cybersecurity inadequacies have substantial impacts on security teams, and importantly, on the customer experience," said Alain Mayer, VP of Product at Bolster. "This can result in significant customer churn and financial losses. We are empowering organizations to avoid these challenges by providing AI tools that are efficient, and automate the fight against phishing scams, impersonation and other fraud schemes."
        Large brands and enterprises are facing a flood of phishing, impersonation, and scam attempts, with some brands receiving upwards of 30,000 emails per month from customers reporting suspicious activity. For SOC personnel, handling these reports manually is inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Additionally, manual processes can take, on average, days to weeks for each individual takedown, with impacts felt by multiple departments including Customer Support, Cybersecurity, Fraud Protection, Legal, Marketing, and more.
        Bolster AI Security for Email handles the entire lifecycle of a threat, from identifying domain registrants to sending cease-and-desist letters and coordinating global takedowns. During beta, the Bolster team identified a high true positive accuracy, with large brands seeing ~35% true positive rate, meaning about 1 in 3 reports of threat are legitimate. This helps organizations to focus resources on real issues, while also reducing internal costs. A recent study has shown that 15% of scammed users do not renew their licenses. AI-driven remediation can help to prevent this.
        "This new feature doesn't just stop phishing threats—it protects your customers' trust. By enabling direct customer generated reporting and automating rapid threat mitigation, brands can demonstrate an active commitment to security," continued Mayer. "This goes beyond employee-driven models by directly engaging those who are most affected. While other tools focus on AI-driven analysis with human oversight, Bolster AI Security for Email fully automates the entire process, from triage to communication with customers, once a threat is neutralized."
        Additionally, AI Security for Email scales effortlessly, so SOC teams can manage tens of thousands of customer-reported emails monthly without requiring additional internal resources.
        This means that takedowns that used to take 1-2 days can now happen in just a few hours, preventing damage before it escalates.

Ameren announces milestones in reliable energy investments

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Ameren Missouri, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE), received approval Wednesday from the Missouri Public Service Commission to build an 800-megawatt (MW) simple-cycle natural gas energy center expected to be ready to serve as a reliable backup source of energy in 2027. The Castle Bluff Energy Center represents an investment of approximately $900 million.
        Castle Bluff is designed to deliver energy on the coldest winter days, the hottest summer afternoons and back up the grid when renewable energy generation is otherwise unavailable.
        "Our customers depend on Ameren Missouri to continue investing in reliability, whether that's through new sources of on-demand energy, including Castle Bluff, or strengthening the grid by replacing aging infrastructure," said Mark Birk, chairman and president of Ameren Missouri. "Through these continued investments, we are ensuring that we have a reliable and resilient energy system to serve customers today and well into the future."
        One of the key aspects of Castle Bluff is the ability to start up on demand and quickly change the level of energy it provides to the grid. On-site construction at Castle Bluff is expected to start next month and create hundreds of construction jobs and several permanent jobs, as well as produce additional tax revenue for the region. Whenever possible, Ameren Missouri hires local and diverse vendors and contractors. By taking advantage of existing infrastructure and transmission line access on the site which the company already owns, Ameren Missouri will be able to reduce overall construction time and costs to customers.
        "When solar energy predictably rises and then falls every day, it is vital to have Castle Bluff as a backup and working as a partner to renewables," said Ajay Arora, senior vice president and chief development officer at Ameren Missouri.
        Ameren Missouri is also announcing it has acquired the Huck Finn Renewable Energy Center, a 200-MW solar facility in Audrain and Ralls counties in Missouri. Huck Finn is the third utility-scale solar facility Ameren Missouri has acquired this year. The Boomtown and Cass County Renewable Energy Centers were acquired earlier this year. Together, the three solar facilities have a combined capacity of 500 MW and represent a total acquisition cost of approximately $900 million. All three are in the later stages of development and are expected to begin producing energy for customers by the end of this year. 
        "We're delivering on our strategy to invest in energy infrastructure for the benefit of our customers with these three facilities representing the next step in providing our customers with a diverse generation portfolio of low-cost energy," Birk said.
        Combined, the three facilities are anticipated to generate energy sufficient to power 92,000 homes annually. 
        Ameren Missouri acquired the 150-MW Cass County Renewable Energy Center in June. Located in Cass County, Illinois, it will serve Ameren Missouri's Renewable Solutions program. The 150-MW Boomtown Renewable Energy Center is in White County, Illinois, and will also serve the Renewable Solutions program. The Boomtown Renewable Energy Center was acquired in late September.

BorgWarner Extends Transfer Case Business with North American OEM

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - BorgWarner, a global product leader in delivering innovative and sustainable mobility solutions, is furthering its business with a major North American OEM by securing extensions on two transfer case contracts for upcoming vehicle launches with new platform requirements. BorgWarner will supply two types of transfer cases, including its active Electro-Mechanical On-Demand 2-Speed (EMOD) and a part-time Electric Shift-on-the-Fly 2-Speed (ESOF) transfer case. Two of the OEM's combustion and hybrid passenger truck platforms will be equipped with the EMOD and ESOF, while an additional passenger truck will receive the ESOF. Start of production for two of the platforms are slated for 2027, with the third expected to begin in 2028.   
        "We have supplied this OEM with transfer cases for its combustion and hybrid passenger truck platforms for over 40 years, and we are honored to have the opportunity to once again provide our transfer cases for several of their upcoming models," said Isabelle McKenzie, Vice President of BorgWarner Inc. and President and General Manager, Drivetrain and Morse Systems. "These extensions solidify our team's reputation and the proven architecture, performance, reliability and quality of our transfer case products. We're very much looking forward to providing our valued customer with exceptional service for its vehicle platforms."
        The EMOD is a high-performance active transfer case that offers faster response, improved torque accuracy, and pre-emptive torque management that enhances the overall safety and stability of the vehicle. The heart of the EMOD is a motor driven clutch-apply system that allows for active modulation of torque distribution between the front and rear wheels based on a variety of continuously monitored vehicle parameters.  While used in several other of the OEM's platforms, this is the first time the EMOD transfer case has been adopted for this particular passenger truck platform.
        Specifically designed to handle the rugged requirements of a part-time four-wheel drive system in a heavy-duty truck, the ESOF transfer case offers a highly efficient two-wheel drive mode in conjunction with the ability to lock the vehicle into four-wheel drive while in motion. It performs these functions while delivering superior noise, vibration and harshness engineering and design to deliver superior performance. The quick and smooth-shifting ESOF technology has a proven track record, reaching its third vehicle evolution for the passenger truck platform.
        Both transfer cases are equipped with BorgWarner's HY-VO® driveline chain, which is optimized for high efficiency and improved durability. The EMOD is equipped with BorgWarner's premium friction products and the entire family of transfer cases will be manufactured at its Seneca, South Carolina production facility.

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Peabody (NYSE: BTU) today reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $101.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $119.9 million, or $0.82 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Peabody had Adjusted EBITDA1 of $224.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.
        "In the third quarter, we delivered strong operational and safety performance across all segments and completed $100 million of share repurchases," said Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Grech. "We continue to execute on our strategy and recently provided a comprehensive update on Centurion, repositioning Peabody as a leading metallurgical coal producer."
        Peabody expected seaborne thermal volume of 4.0 million tons, including 2.5 million export tons, at costs of $48 to $53 per ton. Better than anticipated production and costs drove Adjusted EBITDA margin per ton higher by 15 percent compared to the second quarter. Higher production resulted in adding approximately 300 thousand tons to saleable coal inventory during the quarter. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA margins of 38 percent and Adjusted EBITDA of $120.0 million.
        Peabody expected seaborne met volume of 1.7 million tons at costs of $120 to $130 per ton. Third quarter shipments and costs were in-line with expectations. We opportunistically withheld nearly 90 thousand tons of shipments at Shoal Creek to avoid higher alternate logistics costs and weak market conditions for spot sales. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million and is positioned for a stronger fourth quarter.
        Peabody expected PRB volumes of 21.5 million tons at costs of $11.50 to $12.50 per ton. Better than expected customer nominations and continued focus on cost management increased Adjusted EBITDA margins to $2.34 per ton, more than double the second quarter. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA margins of 17 percent and Adjusted EBITDA of $51.7 million.
        Peabody expected Other U.S. Thermal volume of 4.0 million tons at costs of approximately $44 to $48 per ton. Peabody delivered 4.0 million tons at costs of $46.50 per ton, in-line with expectations. For the quarter, the segment reported Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13 percent and Adjusted EBITDA of $28.4 million.
        On October 14, 2024, Peabody provided a comprehensive update on the Centurion premium hard coking coal project (click here to view), estimating a net present value of $1.6 billion with a 25 percent internal rate of return. The project is expected to produce 4.7 million tons annually at first quartile costs over a 25 plus year mine life. Two continuous miner units are operational, first development coal was produced in June, first coal was washed in September and first customer shipment is scheduled for the fourth quarter. Peabody has invested $250 million of the projected $489 million needed to reach longwall production in March 2026. Centurion's benchmark premium hard coking coal from the Bowen Basin is highly attractive to customers in the Asian market, making Centurion a cornerstone asset in Peabody's global coal portfolio. 
        During the third quarter of 2024, Peabody repurchased 4.5 million shares for a total of $100 million. The total repurchases for the year is 7.7 million shares totaling $180.4 million. Since recommencing the program in 2023, Peabody has repurchased 23.8 million shares for a total amount of $530.4 million, leaving $469.6 million remaining under its existing $1 billion share repurchase program.

        IP's GCF business creates safe, high-quality absorbent pulp for a wide range of applications like feminine care, incontinence and other personal care products that promote health and wellness. In addition, its specialty pulp serves as a sustainable raw material used in textiles, construction materials, paints, coatings and more. The GCF business generated $2.9B in revenue in 2023 and has operations in three countries, with eight mills and two converting facilities.
        "International Paper is committed to maximizing value for our shareholders, and to that end, we have launched a comprehensive and thorough review of strategic options for our global cellulose fibers business," said International Paper Chairman and CEO Andy Silvernail.
        "GCF is focused on accelerating earnings by aligning resources with our most strategic fluff pulp customers, implementing an 80/20 mindset and creating a simplified and focused portfolio. Our team is well-positioned to win with attractive customers in the growing global fluff pulp market," said Clay Ellis, Senior Vice President, Global Cellulose Fibers, International Paper. "Throughout our review, we will maintain our strong customer relationships with the same high standards and close collaboration."
        International Paper has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as financial advisor to help review strategic options for the GCF business. The review of strategic options is at an early stage, and there can be no assurance that this review will result in any kind of transaction or other outcome. The Company will provide updates on the progress or status of this matter if and when it deems further disclosure is required or appropriate.
        IP to Close Georgetown, S.C. Pulp and Paper MillAdditionally, the Company announced the permanent closure of its Georgetown, South Carolina mill. The mill will shut down in stages with a full closure expected by the end of 2024.
        The Georgetown mill produces approximately 300,000 tons of fluff pulp designed for a range of consumer applications from baby diapers to incontinence products. GCF plans to retain 100% of the mill's fluff pulp capacity by transferring production to other mills and further reducing the Company's exposure to commodity pulp grades.
        The mill also produces uncoated freesheet papers that it sells to Sylvamo (NYSE: SLVM) pursuant to a strategic contract, which IP and Sylvamo have mutually agreed to terminate as of December 31, 2024.
        "This decision is especially difficult because of the impact on hard-working employees, their families and the surrounding communities," said Bernie Chascin, Georgetown mill manager, International Paper.
        In total, 526 hourly employees and 148 salaried employees will be impacted. All employees will be offered severance benefits, outplacement services and access to mental health resources.

Recurrent Energy to deliver 1,800 MWh of energy storage and 150 MWac of solar capacity to Arizona Public Service by 2026

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar Inc. ("Canadian Solar") (NASDAQ: CSIQ) and a global developer, owner, and operator of solar and energy storage assets, announced today that it has signed two new tolling agreements with Arizona Public Service Company (APS).
        The 20-year tolling agreements encompass the Desert Bloom Storage and Papago Solar projects. Both projects, located in Maricopa County, Arizona, are scheduled to start construction in 2025 and reach operation in 2026. Desert Bloom Storage is a 600 MWh standalone storage facility, while Papago Solar is a 150 MWac solar facility.
        Last year, Recurrent Energy announced that it had secured a 20-year tolling agreement with APS for its 1,200 MWh Papago Storage project. The Papago Storage project is currently in construction and scheduled to commence operations in 2025. Once operational, Papago Storage will be the largest standalone energy storage project in Arizona.
        Together, the three announced tolling agreements with APS total 1,800 MWh of energy storage and 150 MWac of solar. This is enough energy storage to dispatch power for the equivalent of 72,000 homes for four hours and enough solar to power the equivalent of approximately 24,000 homes per year.
        Brian Cole, APS Vice President of Resource Management, said, "With more people and businesses moving to Arizona, we expect our customers' energy needs to continue to increase significantly over the next several years. We are thoughtfully planning to meet that growing demand with reliable and clean electricity at the lowest cost possible through the addition of projects like Desert Bloom Storage, Papago Solar, and Papago Storage."
        Recurrent Energy is one of the world's largest clean energy platforms. To date, Recurrent Energy has brought online 3.7 GWh of battery energy storage and 11 GWp of solar power projects.
        Ismael Guerrero, CEO of Recurrent Energy, said, "Our partnership with APS on 1.8 GWh of storage and 150 MW of solar capacity represents a remarkable build out of energy infrastructure in the Phoenix area. APS has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, and we are thankful for APS's trust as we provide the projects needed to help satisfy Arizona's growing electricity demand. We look forward to continuing to build an enduring partnership with APS."
        Arizona currently has 1,000 MW of operating energy storage, and renewable energy makes up 12 percent of the state's electricity mix. To keep up with growing demand, by 2030, Arizona anticipates adding 7,600 MW of utility-scale solar power, 1,700 MW of wind power, and 5,900 MW of battery storage—enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of over 5 million homes. This projected clean energy capacity represents $14 billion in expected capital investment[1]. 
        Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, said, "As Arizona continues to grow and attract more technology and manufacturing investments, innovative solar and energy storage projects like this are a critical piece of providing clean, affordable, reliable power to our state's businesses and families. These new agreements will advance Arizona's transition towards a renewable energy future and leadership in clean energy innovation."

Golden Arrow Intersects 310m @ 0.19% Copper in 400m Step-Out Drill Hole at the San Pietro Project, Chile

        Friday - November 01: (RWE) - Golden Arrow Resources Corporation (TSXV: GRG) (FSE: G6A) (OTCQB: GARWF), ("Golden Arrow" or the "Company") is pleased to report a significant expansion of the Rincones target, where diamond drill hole SP-DDH-29 stepped out nearly 400 metres to the south (see Figure 1) and hit multiple significant intervals of copper, gold, cobalt and iron mineralization between 100 metres and 519 metres depth, highlighted by: 
        Brian McEwen, VP Exploration and Development for Golden Arrow, commented, "With over 300 metres averaging 0.19% Cu and 0.06 g/t Au, the significance of the results of hole 29 cannot be overstated. At a 400 m step-out from the mineralized zones at Rincones, these results indicate the potential to greatly expand a resource footprint with minimal additional infill drilling. In addition, mineralization is open laterally along the northwest-southeast trend into largely untested areas. We are now starting additional holes to provide the drill density to include this in our Rincones resource calculation, as well as to test the lateral extent of this new mineralization." 
        Mr. McEwen continued, "In the even bigger picture, this large step-out was in the mostly untested area between Rincones and the Colla target, located about 600 metres further south-southeast. At Colla, the limited drilling to date has hit spectacular cobalt and iron intervals over several hundred metres of strike, in addition to new copper and gold intercepts. If we can continue to find new mineralization that closes the gap between the Rincones and Colla targets it could be a game-changer for the project moving forward."
        The three holes reported herein are part of the ~10,000-metre diamond drilling campaign at the San Pietro Iron Oxide-Copper-Gold-Cobalt ("IOCG") Project in Chile ("San Pietro" or the "Project") announced on April 24, 2024, which is expected to provide data for the first Mineral Resource Estimate for the project. The drilling program is approximately 80% complete.

Quanta completed eight acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024 and five acquisitions during the full year 2023, and the results of the acquired businesses are included in Quanta's consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability of 2024 and 2023, see the footnotes in the accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP financial measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.

        The long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive.

Additionally, we continue to consider future uncertainty associated with overall challenges to the domestic and global economy, including inflation, interest rates and potential recessionary economic conditions. Quanta's financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management's effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog the Company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during the remainder of 2024.
